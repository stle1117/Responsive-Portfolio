                    <p>I am an IT Business Analyst with a strong interest in Web-Development. 
                        Someday I hope to be a Web-Developer also.
                        It is extremely exciting to me to be in a Web Development Bootcamp here at
                         Vanderbilt University (VU).  I earned my undergraduate degree at VU too.  
                    </p><br>
                    <p>I spend most of my time working or spending time with my two children.
                        I enjoy yoga, running, zumba, and barre classes.  Barre classes are my favorite
                        exercise classes because they are the most challenging.  The most enjoyable thing
                        about the classes is when I use the barre company's app. to cancel classes
                        because I want to sleep in the morning instead of exercising.  It's a cool 
                        app.
